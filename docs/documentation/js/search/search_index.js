Fin -  Dhuum se met dans une bulle au centre, il faut intéragir avec les emplacements des faucheurs à peu          près en même temps et revenir dans la bulle pour attaquer le boss. A répeter jusqu\\'à sa mort. Les joueurs en dehors          de la bulle perdent rapidement de la vie.                                  Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.                                                        Soul Siphon -  La lumière blanche au centre tue tout de suite. Elle aspire constamment le joueur vers elle.                          Orbes -  Il faut manger 5 orbes rouges pour revenir. Essayez de manger une grande orbe sinon un Enforcer          va apparaître. Si aucune grande orbe n\\'est mangée, prévenir le raid.                                  Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.                                    Mouvement -  Le mouvement est plan, ne vous faîtes pas avoir, toutes les orbes ne sont pas à votre niveau.                          Conseil -  Il se peut qu\\'il n\\'y ait pas d\\'orbes dans votre quadran, pour vous déplacer rapidement, avancer          vers le mur puis foncer dans l\\'autre sens en contourant le siphon. Ce dernier va vous faire gagner en vitesse.

Seulement durant la première phase ou          si une grande orbe a été loupée.                                  Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.

Messenger -  Add golem, attaque la première personne qui les touche. Possède une zone autour qui inflige          de gros dégats aux joueurs. Meurt 20 secondes après son apparition. La fréquence d\\'apparition est très élevée durant          la première phase seulement.

Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.                                    Bombes -  5 joueurs aléatoires reçoivent une bombe qui provoque des dégâts mineurs sur le joueur choisi          mais catastrophiques sur ses alliés. Attention au debuff de renversement.                                  Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.                                                        Phase -  Toutes les 30 sec le boss change de phase dans l\\'ordre Glace - Feu - Pluie. Chaque phase garde          ses mécaniques. En Feu, 4 tornades au lieu de 2. En Pluie, 2 tempêtes au lieu de 1.                          Sacrifice -  Il n\\'y a plus de sacrifice durant la phase abomination.                          Bombes -  Les bombes ne sont plus propres à la phase Pluie et affectent 10 personnes au lieu de 5.                                  Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.                                    Hadoken -  Cette mécanique n\\'est plus propre à la phase Glace. L\\'animation est plus rapide.                          Shards of Rage (Les éclats) -  Cette mécanique change d\\'animation: au lieu de tirer dans toutes les directions,          le boss va lancer les éclats en l\\'air.                                  Merci à              Dulfy pour l\\'image.                                    Ghostly Spirit (les esprits) -  Sur un cycle de 45 secondes. Un esprit va apparaître dans un coin de la          salle et va la traverser en longueur (15 secondes). Un deuxième esprit va apparaître dès que le premier termine          son trajet (15 secondes). Dès que le deuxième a fini son trajet, le raid a 15 secondes de répit avant que le cycle          ne recommence. Les esprits ont une zone autour d\\'eux, les joueurs touchés subissent des dégâts catastrophiques.
